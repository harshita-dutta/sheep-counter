# sheep-counter (Simulated using Tinkercad)
### Using two ultrasonic sensors, connected to Arduino Uno, we detect the number of sheeps inside the fenced area.
##### The first sensor with trigPin1 and echoPin1 detects sheeps entering the fenced area.
##### The second sensor with trigPin2 and echoPin2 detects sheeps leaving the fenced area.
##### Assumptions - 
###### 1. A single sheep enters or leaves the fenced area at a time.
###### 2. The width of the gate through which a sheep enters or leaves is considered to be 100cm.
###### 3. The average time taken by a sheep to enter or leave the fenced area through the gates is 800ms.
