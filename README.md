# sheep-counter (Simulated using Tinkercad)
### Using two UV sensors, connected to Arduino Uno, we detect the number of sheeps inside the fenced area.
##### The first sensor with trigPin1 and echoPin1 detects sheeps entering the fenced area.
##### The second sensor with trigPin2 and echoPin2 detects sheeps leaving the fenced area.
